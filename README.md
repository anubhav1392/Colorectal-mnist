Overview
The dataset serves as a much more interesting MNIST or CIFAR10 problem for biologists by focusing on histology tiles from patients with colorectal cancer. In particular, 
the data has 8 different classes of tissue (but Cancer/Not Cancer can also be an interesting problem).

This Classifier model is using InceptionV3 network to generate features and no data augmentation has been applied.
Training accuracy was 98% while validation accuracy was 96%.
